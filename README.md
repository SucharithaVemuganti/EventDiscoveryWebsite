## Design and Technical Decisions

- *RESTful API*: The application interacts with a backend RESTful API to fetch data about events, including upcoming events and ongoing live shows.
- *Infinite Scrolling*: To improve user experience, infinite scrolling is implemented for fetching additional upcoming events when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page.

- *FontAwesome Icons*: FontAwesome icons are used for visual elements such as search, location, and user profile to enhance the user interface.
